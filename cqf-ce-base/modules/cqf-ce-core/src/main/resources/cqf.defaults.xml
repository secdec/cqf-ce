<!DOCTYPE config>
<!--

	This is a sample configuration file used for the Cyber Quantification Framework.
	This configuration file is processed by the Apache Commons Configuration library,
	and as such supports variable interpolation. The entries in this configuration
	file are marked with:

	* mandatory - for properties that must be present in a real configuration file

	* optional - for properties that are optional in a real configuration file

	* auxiliary - for properties defined for interpolation within other values.
	If these properties are not used by other properties in the file, they can
	be removed safely.

	Note that Apache Commons Configuration supports interpolation of environment variables
	as well. If the CQF applications are being run as webapps within Tomcat, it may
	be useful to define properties in terms of ${env:CATALINA_HOME} or ${env:CATALINA_BASE}.
