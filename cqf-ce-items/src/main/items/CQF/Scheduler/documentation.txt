@info Handles out-of-band scheduling for experiments that can operate
@info independently of CQF during their run phase.  The run phase itself is
@info divided into six slots: initialize, setup, start sensors, main, stop
@info sensors, and cleanup.  Each slot is identified by an offset in
@info minutes from the start of the run phase within the experiment's
@info overall execution lifecycle.
